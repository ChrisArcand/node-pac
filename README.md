node-packmod
============

Pack your node_modules as *.tgz files for version control and easy deploys

Why?
----

Because commiting the `node_modules` into source control sucks. It kills
diffs and makes code reviews shitty.

Installation
------------

`npm install -g packmod`

Usage
-----

From a command prompt, run `packmod` from your project's root directory.

TODO
----

* add support for tagged versions
* add support for modules installed from a repo url
* tests
* refactoring
